	Expanded definition of signature format
	Changed the (proposed) directory structure and naming convention to eliminate ambiguities, add consistancy and slightly better match existing structure

2019-11-05 Lee Moore <moore@imperas.com>
    * Restructured RV32I to move Zicsr and Zifencei into their own suites

2019-10-14 Lee Moore <moore@imperas.com>
    * Added Ability to run a single test by using the Make Variable RISCV_TEST
    for example, to only run the test I-ADD-01 from the rv32i suite
        make RISCV_ISA=rv32i RISCV_TEST=I-ADD-01
    * Added Top Level Variable to Makefile RISCV_TARGET_FLAGS, 
    in the case of the RISCV_TARGET this can be passed and appended to the invocation
    commandline configuration, for example to pass a command line flag to the RISCV_TARGET
    to perform tracing. The value of this flag will be target specific
        make RISCV_ISA=rv32i RISCV_TEST=I-ADD-01 RISCV_TARGET_FLAGS="--trace"
    This is has also been added to all other targets to allow target configuration from
    the commandline

2019-10-07 Philipp Wagner <phw@lowrisc.org>
    * When executing the test suite, Ibex always writes an instruction
      log. Update the Makefile to write it to a test-specific location
      (next to all other log files).
    * On Ibex, provide an additional .objdump-noalias disassembly file
      with no aliases and numeric register names (instead of ABI names).
      This file matches the Ibex trace and can be used to debug the test
      runs.
